Datasets and Data Processing for the American History Matters Project

I know that there are a lot of files. Only 3 of them really matter. 

Firstly, the DataFraming notebook as that shows how Data Processing was done. 

Secondly. The AmericanHistoryMatters RMD files which shows how to generate the matrices.

Lastly, we have the PosteriorTestFinal notebook which does all the computation for the tests. 

Also, the Rms files are critical if you don't have a day or two to compute the models.
